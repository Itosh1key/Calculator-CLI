What would you like to do?
1) Basic Arithmetic (+, -, *, /, or %)
2) Additional Arithmetic (POW, SQRT, DS, or DR)
3) Quit
>1

Enter a number: 47.8
Enter an operation (+, -, *, /, or %): /
Enter another number: 4.2

47.8 / 4.2 = 11.381

Do you wish to perform another calculation? (y/n): y

What would you like to do?
1) Basic Arithmetic (+, -, *, /, or %)
2) Additional Arithmetic (POW, SQRT, DS, or DR)
3) Quit
>2

Enter a number: 2

Select an additonal Arithmetic operation:
1) Exponentiation (POW)
2) Square Root (SQRT)
3) Digit Sum (DS)
4) Digital Root (DR)
5) Back
>1

Enter an exponent: 64

2^64 = 1.84467e+19
